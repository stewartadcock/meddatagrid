This component was derived from the DevAge SourceGrid 3. This project
was forked by MEDIT at the end of 2005, under the terms of a MIT-like
license, and some later bug-fixes from the parent SourceGrid project
were later back-ported into this MEDIT fork. The original license is
provided below.

The latest version of the parent project is now available at
http://sourcegrid.codeplex.com/

During 2011, MEDIT provided access to their fork to Felix Concordia
under the terms of the previous MIT-like license, and it is under
these terms that Felix Concordia now provides the code for public
consumption at http://code.google.com/p/meddatagrid under the on-going
sponsorship of MEDIT.
