  /// <summary>
  /// A general-purpose grid control for .Net.
  ///
  /// This code was extracted from the legacy versions of the
  /// <see href="http://medit.dynalias.net/twiki/bin/view/Main/MedSumoGui">MED-SuMo GUI</see>, and it is clear that
  /// the original basis for this code was the open source <see href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/grid/csharpgridcontrol.aspx">SourceGrid</see>.
  /// Unfortunately compatibility was broken, by the poorly conceived addition of domain-specific logic, so updating
  /// to more recent versions of SourceGrid would not be straightforward.
  ///
  /// More recently, the code has undergone extensive cleaning and numerous bug-fixes and many enhancements were made.
  /// The resulting MEDDataGrid is now a robust, reliable and maintainable, general-purpose datagrid, or table, control.
  ///
  /// Visit the <see href="http://medit.hd.free.fr/twiki/bin/view/Main/MedDataGrid">Wiki</see> for further details.
