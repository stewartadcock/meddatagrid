This component was derived from the DevAge SourceGrid 3. This project was forked by MEDIT at the end of 2005, under the terms of a MIT-like license, and some later bug-fixes from the parent SourceGrid project were later back-ported into this MEDIT fork.

The latest version of the parent project is available at http://sourcegrid.codeplex.com/

During 2011, MEDIT provided access to their fork to Felix Concordia under the terms of the previous MIT-like license, and it was under these terms that Felix Concordia now provided the code for public consumption at https://code.google.com/p/meddatagrid under the sponsorship of MEDIT. This code was automatically migrated to GutHub in 2015 to allow for on-going maintenance.

For further licensing and contact details, see license.txt within the source code repository.
